##Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design.

With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.

You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:




<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>

#<button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button>
  <button class="btn btn-block btn-info">Info</button>
  <button class="btn btn-block btn-danger">Delete</button>


  ##Take for example Bootstrap's col-md-* class. Here, md means medium, and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. In this case, the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop, is being specified.

In the Cat Photo App that we're building, we'll use col-xs-*, where xs means extra small (like an extra-small mobile phone screen), and * is the number of columns specifying how many columns wide the element should be.

##In this case, we've already added it for you to this page behind the scenes.

The i element was originally used to make other elements italic, but is now commonly used for icons. You can add the Font Awesome classes to the i element to turn it into an icon, for example:

<i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
